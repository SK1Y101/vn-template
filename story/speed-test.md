This is a test of different speeds

You can specify a colour for the entire story part

It can be a raw time in ms to render each line, otherwise it will use the config default

You can also apply modifiers, fastest-slowest

/pace 100ms you can specify pace per sentence in millis too

/slowest or specify a modified per sentence to change the speed

/slow you can still only have one though!
