You can add effects for the entire block, but we won't do that now

Instead, here's an example of every possible one!

\shake shake
\nudge nudge
\bounce bounce
\slide-left slide-left
\slide-right slide-right
\pulse pulse
\blink blink
\grow grow
\pop pop
\glow glow
\tilt tilt
\wobble wobble
\wave wave

This is exciting, but you can even add multiple ffects per line!

/wave /glow like waving and glowing at once.
