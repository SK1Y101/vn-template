This is a test of different colours

You can specify a colour for the entire story part

/gold or specify a new colour per sentence, `\{name}`

/green there can only be one colour per sentence (waht would gold-green even be?)

/mediumpurple you can use and of the 148 CSS3 colours

/colour #ef0 or specify a hex code with `/colour (code)`

let's learn about some other modifiers. each can be stacked, like `colour` and `speed`
