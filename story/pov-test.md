We can make it clearly clear who is talking or narating a section

by adding the POV marker around the entire part

but maybe another person wan't to offer an opition

/pov author just like this, perhaps

in that case, unless there's a POV colour defined in the config, it will randomly assign one

/pov author2 like this!

/pov You oh and don't worry about accidentally doubling up, This line is your POV

/pov You and so is this one

/pov author notice how that was all perfectly fine?

/pov Author don't worry, the random colour choice persists to future lines, but POV Name is case-sensitive
/pov Author unless you modify the config!
